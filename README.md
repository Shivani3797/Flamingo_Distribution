# General Introduction
### According to an eye-opening survey conducted by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), there was a slight decrease in the number of Greater Flamingos (IUCN (least concern)) in Maharashtra between May 2018 and May 2019. As a result, I conducted this study titled "Forecasting future of Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) in Maharashtra, India under the influence of climate change" to analyse the situation and provide management-based solutions. For this study, I used Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) to compare current and future species distributions in relation to two major climate factors, Tmin and rainfall. For both factors, I used CMIP5 50-year climate projections. 

### In order to strengthen our findings, I conducted a short-term time series analysis of the aforementioned climatic factors for the study area.

### Furthermore, while Greater Flamingos were seen in a variety of locations throughout the study area, Bhigwan Bird Sanctuary was the location where this species was seen the most, even more than its counterpart Lesser Flamingos. As a result, spectral indices for the region were computed in order to assess the ecological health of its primary habitat.

# RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
### 1.) To model species distribution of Greater Flamingos using GLM for the year 2070 in Maharashtra.
### 2.) Time-series analysis of predictor variables (Tmin, Precipitation) to comprehend trends for short-term climate forecast of the study area and ecologically relevant areas to species in the current scenario.
### 3.) Calculating Spectral Indices to assess the ecological health of the sub-study area, Bhigwan Bird Sanctuary (only known major hotspot of Greater Flamingos in Maharashtra).

# CONCLUSION
## Evaluating the effect of climate factors on species distribution is of considerable significance to species conservation. The GLM model results made it clear that environmental conditions are extremely important for species occurrence. A negative P value for rainfall in study area indicates towards diminishing occurrence of Greater flamingos with increasing precipitation. The AUC value of 0.685 denotes acceptable model validity. Also, with increasing global warming and more pollution, the climate for the species will not be favorable in the future in the study area. The current feeding grounds of Greater flamingos may not be the apt fulfilling source in future. The species will expand its range in the study area, it will move towards south and central parts to fulfill its dietary needs in future. Based on the results, the future of species seems bleak in the country. 

## The short-term trend of ten years with increasing precipitation and decreasing Tmin in state of Maharashtra, further depicts unfavorable conditions for presence of Greater flamingos in near future. It clearly indicates unfavourable conditions of Maharshtra being a feeding ground in recent future. In NDWI and NDVI of year 2021, we can observe significant decrease in NDVI and NDWI towards east of study area from year 2017. High reflectance of MSI in study area denotes high extent of vegetation in study area in year 2017. Notwithstanding, values till 1.2 signifies high pressure and less water content in leaves of study area.SABI values went from - 0.0 to 1.5, with the districts close to the south east of the review region toward the finish of the stream mouth having more qualities approaching 1.5, showing the presence of water section algal sprouts, and the northern locale, close to the Bhigwan Untamed life safe-haven, having values approaching 0.5 or above, demonstrating the presence of less algal blossoms in the region.Hence, with reducing water assets and algal blossom inside a time of 4 years, we can derive that natural circumstances for taking care of ground of flamingos is in weak state and preservation moves ought to be made at earliest.

## Based on the results, the future of species seems bleak in the country. The now least concern species, is migratory, joins links between different climatic landmasses. Hence, apt conservation efforts should be taken for the Greater Flamingo species in Maharashtra.
